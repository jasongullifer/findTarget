findTargey.py - Jason W. Gullifer - 2013

This program will loop through many trials in a csv input file
(readFileName) to find the position in a sentence, starting at 0, of a
given target word. The new data set will be output as a csv file
(writeFileName).

Sentence should be supplied under a column (sentenceColumn), and each
target word is supplied by column entitled (targetWordColumn"). The
position will be output as column (targetROIColumn).

ReadFile and WriteFile are supplied for easy reading and writing of
csv files.
